<br><h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>This is designed to simulate fault tolerance, or the ability of a network to continue despite failures. <br> When "Line mode" (the checkbox) is off, clicks create boxes. <br> These boxes represent areas where information is traveling. <br> When "Line mode" is on, you can click between two boxes to create a path. <br> These paths are how information travels through the boxes. <br> A system is "fault tolerant" if it can withstand some of these paths being "cut", or decommissioned. <br> The point of this is to create a system, and see how fault tolerant it is at the bottom.</p>
