	<h3> What do I classify as a "mozzarella stick"? </h3>
	<p> I consider a "mozzarella stick" to be any food item that consists of nothing more than cheese surrounded by some kind of bread/breading. <br> The type of cheese and bread do not matter, the cheese must be inside the bread, and that must be the entire snack. </p>
