<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>This little "game" is meant to mirror a code.org excercise I did a while ago, something about compression. <br> You type repeated phrases or combinations of words into the text area (each new line is a different phrase), and it "compresses" them into single symbols. <br> Admittedly, I was a bit too lazy to do the symbol thing, so instead I just used the line number followed by a tilde (~). <br> Please note that any number more than single digits, as well as the tildes, are not counted in the final "score". <br> Your "score" is represented by the length of the original file minus the length of the paragraph and text area. </p>
